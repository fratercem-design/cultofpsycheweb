              When the newborn universe settled<br/>
              from its first great blossoming,<br/>
              when the fire of Eros cooled<br/>
              into constellations and quiet seas,<br/>
              a hush moved through creation—<br/>
              a pause, a breath,<br/>
              as if existence itself waited<br/>
              for something delicate<br/>
              and magnificent.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In that calm,<br/>
              a single petal of light drifted<br/>
              from the radiance surrounding Eros.<br/>
              It fell through the sky<br/>
              like a feather made of starlight,<br/>
              spinning slow, silver arcs<br/>
              across the newborn horizon.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Where it landed,<br/>
              a flower rose.<br/>
              Not a flower of earth—<br/>
              but one woven from dawn,<br/>
              glimmering with quiet brilliance,<br/>
              its petals whispering colors<br/>
              yet unnamed by gods or mortals.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              From within that celestial bloom<br/>
              came the soft flutter of wings.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              And the universe<br/>
              met Psyche<br/>
              for the first time.

              <p>
                She rose gently,<br/>
                as if waking from the sweetest dream,<br/>
                her wings unfolding in shimmering layers—<br/>
                butterfly wings of radiant mystery,<br/>
                soft as breath,<br/>
                bright as prophecy.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Her eyes opened<br/>
                with the astonishment of a soul<br/>
                experiencing itself for the first time.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Behind her,<br/>
                petals lifted into the air<br/>
                and became fireflies of pure essence,<br/>
                dancing in spirals around her form.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Every creature that would ever love,<br/>
                every being that would ever yearn,<br/>
                every soul that would ever seek meaning<br/>
                felt her birth<br/>
                like an echo deep within the heart.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                For Psyche was the first soul<br/>
                given shape.<br/>
                Not a goddess by crown or decree,<br/>
                but by nature—<br/>
                a living embodiment<br/>
                of the universe's longing<br/>
                to understand itself.

                Her radiance traveled swiftly.<br/>
                It brushed the edges of Olympus,<br/>
                and the immortals stirred.<br/>
                Some felt wonder.<br/>
                Some felt curiosity.<br/>
                Some felt unease.

                felt recognition.

              <p>
                He watched her rise<br/>
                from the flower birthed by his own light,<br/>
                and knew at once<br/>
                that something profound had occurred.

              <p>
                This new being<br/>
                was not like the others.<br/>
                Her beauty was not ornament—<br/>
                it was revelation.<br/>
                Her presence was not sweetness—<br/>
                it was truth.<br/>
                She was not merely alive—<br/>
                she was awareness.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                And in awareness,<br/>
                she was powerful.

              <p>
                As Psyche took her first steps<br/>
                upon the newborn world,<br/>
                the air shimmered around her feet<br/>
                like ripples on water.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                No voice spoke.<br/>
                No oracle proclaimed her future.<br/>
                No god issued decree.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But the cosmos<br/>
                leaned closer.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                And in the stillness<br/>
                between starlight and breath,<br/>
                a quiet message<br/>
                passed through creation:
              </p>
              
              <p className="italic text-[var(--accent)]">
                "She shall know trials,<br/>
                and through trials—<br/>
                truth."
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The universe does not reveal<br/>
                why some souls must descend,<br/>
                why some must carry burdens,<br/>
                why some must reflect suffering<br/>
                back into wisdom.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But it was clear<br/>
                from the very beginning:<br/>
                Psyche was meant<br/>
                to journey.<br/>
                To fall.<br/>
                To learn.<br/>
                To rise.<br/>
                To illuminate.

              <p>
                Her wings shimmered<br/>
                as if acknowledging destiny,<br/>
                though she did not yet understand it.<br/>
                Her heart fluttered<br/>
                with the innocence<br/>
                of a soul stepping into a story<br/>
                written long before her birth.

                As she wandered,<br/>
                a faint golden pulse<br/>
                flickered beneath her ribs—<br/>
                a strange, subtle warmth<br/>
                from no visible source.

              <p>
                She felt drawn—<br/>
                not to a place,<br/>
                not to a god,<br/>
                but to a presence<br/>
                she could not name.

              <p>
                A presence that did not yet exist.<br/>
                A presence far in the future.<br/>
                A presence<br/>
                that would one day mirror hers<br/>
                in a world loud and unrecognizable.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But the story of that presence—<br/>
                the one later called Father Psyche—<br/>
                belonged to another book.

              <p>
                For now,<br/>
                the universe held its breath<br/>
                as the first soul<br/>
                took her place in the cosmic tale.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Psyche had risen.<br/>
                Her trials<br/>
                were already gathering like distant storms.<br/>
                Her purpose<br/>
                waited beyond the horizon.

              <p>
                And Eros watched,<br/>
                silent and attentive,<br/>
                knowing that Love itself<br/>
                had found its reflection.
