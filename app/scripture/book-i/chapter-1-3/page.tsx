              After Psyche's birth,<br/>
              the universe was no longer quiet.<br/>
              Every breeze whispered her name.<br/>
              Every mortal heart beat a little faster.<br/>
              Even the gods felt something shift<br/>
              when she walked across creation<br/>
              with wings that shimmered like dawn.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Her beauty was not ornamental—<br/>
              it was existential.<br/>
              It revealed what the cosmos valued most:<br/>
              the awakening of the soul.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              And not all immortals<br/>
              welcomed such revelation.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[var(--accent)]">THE ORIGIN OF APHRODITE'S CLAIM</h3>
              <p>
                Before mortals prayed to Aphrodite,<br/>
                before she ruled desire's palace,<br/>
                before she crowned herself<br/>
                sovereign of beauty and longing—<br/>
                there existed only one<br/>
                who truly embodied love:<br/>
                Eros.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But Eros was wild, radiant, ungoverned—<br/>
                a being of pure cosmic desire<br/>
                born from the cracked Cosmic Egg itself.<br/>
                He had no mother.<br/>
                No father.<br/>
                No lineage.<br/>
                He was Love unshaped.<br/>
                Desire unbounded.<br/>
                Longing before mythology<br/>
                knew how to speak its name.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                When the younger gods rose to power,<br/>
                they found Eros unsettling—<br/>
                too old,<br/>
                too powerful,<br/>
                too free.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                And so, to control a primordial force,<br/>
                they crafted a story.<br/>
                Aphrodite, born later from sea-foam and starlight,<br/>
                was given the claim:<br/>
                "This is your son."
              </p>
              
              <p>
                A political adoption.<br/>
                A mythological mask.<br/>
                A way to place Love<br/>
                under the rule of Beauty.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Aphrodite accepted the role eagerly.<br/>
                Who would not want dominion<br/>
                over desire itself?
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Thus Eros became her "child" in name,<br/>
                though older than her in truth—<br/>
                a golden-winged being<br/>
                wrapped in a mother's jeweled metaphor.<br/>
                He played the part.<br/>
                He tolerated the pretense.<br/>
                He even amused himself<br/>
                with her clever attempts to guide him.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But deep within,<br/>
                he remained what he always was:<br/>
                the First Light of Creation.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                And nothing—<br/>
                not even a goddess—<br/>
                could dictate whom Love would love.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[var(--accent)]">THE WHISPER OF A NEW RIVAL</h3>
              <p>
                When Aphrodite first heard mortals<br/>
                speaking Psyche's name<br/>
                with trembling reverence,<br/>
                she dismissed it.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But when temples<br/>
                originally dedicated to her<br/>
                were offered incense in Psyche's honor—<br/>
                when women braided Psyche's symbol<br/>
                into their hair—<br/>
                when men carried Psyche's image<br/>
                for protection and fortune—<br/>
                Envy, that ancient serpent,<br/>
                coiled inside her heart.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                "Another beauty?"<br/>
                she hissed.<br/>
                "A mortal who steals my altars?"
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But when she finally saw Psyche,<br/>
                her reaction was not rage—<br/>
                it was fear.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                For the goddess sensed something<br/>
                beneath Psyche's radiance—<br/>
                something older<br/>
                than even her own birth.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The soul recognizes the soul.<br/>
                And Psyche's glow<br/>
                mirrored a light so ancient<br/>
                that Aphrodite felt a chill.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                "This one," she whispered,<br/>
                "is dangerous."
              </p>
              
              <p>
                And so the goddess of beauty<br/>
                summoned her "son."
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[var(--accent)]">THE COMMAND OF APHRODITE</h3>
              <p>
                Aphrodite spoke with shimmering venom:<br/>
                "Make the girl fall in love<br/>
                with a monster.<br/>
                Let her beauty be her curse."
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Eros listened.<br/>
                He smiled politely.<br/>
                He bowed.<br/>
                He accepted the command<br/>
                as dutiful sons do.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But inside his chest,<br/>
                something stirred.<br/>
                A warmth.<br/>
                A recognition.<br/>
                A pull.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The same pull Psyche felt<br/>
                beneath her ribs<br/>
                when she took her first steps.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The golden thread<br/>
                shivered for the first time<br/>
                in divine awareness.

              <p>
                Eros descended to the mortal realm<br/>
                with his quiver of living arrows—<br/>
                one to spark irresistible passion,<br/>
                one to ignite ruinous obsession.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                He approached Psyche's chamber<br/>
                under cover of divine invisibility.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But when he saw her—<br/>
                truly saw her—<br/>
                the cosmos shifted.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Not because of her beauty<br/>
                (though her beauty defied language),<br/>
                but because her soul<br/>
                shone with the same radiance<br/>
                he had glimpsed in the Cosmic Egg<br/>
                when he first stepped into existence.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                He reached for the arrow<br/>
                meant to doom her—<br/>
                and it trembled.<br/>
                He stepped closer.<br/>
                Her breath stirred the air.<br/>
                Her dreams fluttered<br/>
                like soft-winged creatures.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In that moment,<br/>
                the First Light<br/>
                met the First Soul.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                His hand slipped.<br/>
                The arrow meant for her<br/>
                pricked his own flesh.<br/>
                Love fell in love.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Destiny bent around them<br/>
                like metal toward a magnet.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The story from The Golden Ass<br/>
                remembers this moment<br/>
                as a gentle accident.<br/>
                But the deeper truth is this:<br/>
                Love recognized Soul<br/>
                as its equal<br/>
                for the first time.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Eros withdrew, shaken.<br/>
                Confused.<br/>
                Awakened.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                He knew Psyche was not just mortal.<br/>
                Her radiance was not merely physical.<br/>
                Her trials were not simply punishment.<br/>
                She was something else—<br/>
                the beginning of a pattern<br/>
                that even gods could not understand.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                And far in the future,<br/>
                another Psyche—<br/>
                the male, the fire-forged one—<br/>
                would echo her story<br/>
                in a different world.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But the universe<br/>
                was not yet ready<br/>
                to reveal that parallel.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Not yet.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                For now, the myth begins<br/>
                as mortals remember it:<br/>
                A goddess jealous.<br/>
                A soul tested.<br/>
                Love forbidden.<br/>
                Love triumphant.<br/>
                Love lost.<br/>
                Love regained.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But beneath the myth,<br/>
                a deeper current flowed—<br/>
                one that would not surface<br/>
                until the Final Revelation.
