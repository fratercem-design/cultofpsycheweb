            THE TWO FACES OF EROS AND THE WOUND OF LOVE

              Eros did not remain unchanged<br/>
              after seeing Psyche.<br/>
              Before her, he was a force.<br/>
              After her, he was a story.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The old tales say<br/>
              he was born from the Cosmic Egg—<br/>
              first light in the bosom of Night,<br/>
              swift-winged and glittering,<br/>
              his golden feathers cutting through Chaos<br/>
              like a new idea.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In those elder mysteries,<br/>
              he was called Protogonos,<br/>
              the First-Born;<br/>
              Phanes, the Illuminated One;<br/>
              key-bearer of creation,<br/>
              holding not iron keys in his hand,<br/>
              but the invisible keys to hearts.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Later, among poets and priests<br/>
              who preferred their gods more orderly,<br/>
              Eros was recast as a child of Aphrodite—<br/>
              a mischievous boy with a bow,<br/>
              dangling at the edge of her beauty,<br/>
              summoned to stir scandal,<br/>
              to ignite affairs,<br/>
              to tangle gods and mortals<br/>
              in webs of longing.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Both faces were true<br/>
              and neither was complete.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              For Eros was not simply<br/>
              a playful archer,<br/>
              nor only a cosmic ruler.<br/>
              He was the current<br/>
              running between those extremes—<br/>
              tender as a whisper,<br/>
              terrible as obsession,<br/>
              gentle as the first blush,<br/>
              violent as the last goodbye.

                The storytellers remember<br/>
                his paired arsenal:

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">

                With these he moved unseen<br/>

                through palaces and shepherd fields,<br/>
                striking gods and mortals alike—<br/>
                Hades for Persephone,<br/>
                Zeus for countless women,<br/>
                Apollo for Daphne<br/>

              <p>
                They cursed him,<br/>
                mocked him,<br/>
                feared him,<br/>
                and still returned to him,<br/>

                the gravity of his aim.

                Sent by Aphrodite<br/>
                to ruin Psyche,<br/>
                Eros descended<br/>
                expecting routine mischief.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                He had stung countless hearts—<br/>
                a shepherd for a nymph,<br/>
                a king for a stranger,<br/>
                a god for his own niece.<br/>
                He had watched empires rise and fall<br/>
                under the simple logic of longing.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But never before<br/>
                had he faltered.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Invisible beside Psyche's bed,<br/>
                he drew a golden arrow—<br/>
                the kind that would make her<br/>
                burn for something monstrous,<br/>
                a love so misaligned<br/>
                it would shatter her life<br/>
                and restore Aphrodite's pride.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                He leaned close.<br/>
                Her breath brushed his cheek.<br/>
                Her sleeping face held no vanity,<br/>
                no scheming,<br/>
                only the quiet openness<br/>
                of the untested soul.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                In her,<br/>
                he recognized something uncanny—<br/>
                an echo of that first petal of light<br/>
                that emerged when he tore the Cosmic Egg open,<br/>
                the first shimmer of Soul<br/>
                he'd ever known.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                His hand trembled.<br/>
                The arrow slipped.<br/>
                Its tip grazed his own skin.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                A god of love<br/>
                struck by his own weapon.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                The wound was small,<br/>
                but the effect infinite.<br/>
                Love, who had pierced all others,<br/>
                found himself pierced.<br/>
                Desire, who had moved worlds,<br/>
                felt the world move inside him.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                He drew back, startled,<br/>
                but the damage was done.<br/>
                The First-Born of Night<br/>
                was now a lover.

                Under cover of darkness,<br/>
                on winds only he could command,<br/>
                he lifted Psyche from the life<br/>
                that had become a death by envy<br/>
                and carried her away.

              <p>
                Their story, as told in The Golden Ass,<br/>
                remembers the outlines—<br/>
                The hidden palace.<br/>
                The unseen husband.<br/>
                The rule that she must never<br/>
                look upon his face.<br/>
                The jealous sisters<br/>
                who poisoned her trust.<br/>
                The betrayal by lamplight.<br/>
                The burning oil.<br/>
                The wounded god fleeing.<br/>
                The soul cast out<br/>
                into wandering and despair.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                All of that is true.

              <p>
                But beneath the mortal telling<br/>
                lies a deeper current:<br/>
                When Psyche lit the lamp<br/>
                and looked upon Eros,<br/>
                it was not merely curiosity.<br/>
                It was consciousness—<br/>
                the soul daring to see Love<br/>
                as it truly is.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                And when he fled,<br/>
                wounded both in flesh and in trust,<br/>
                it was not only hurt pride.<br/>
                It was the shock<br/>
                of a primordial being<br/>
                confronted by vulnerability.
              </p>

                A god,<br/>
                for the first time,<br/>

              <p>
                In his absence,<br/>
                Psyche wandered the earth,<br/>
                seeking her lost beloved.<br/>
                She knelt at the altars of Demeter,<br/>
                Hera,<br/>
                and finally Aphrodite herself,<br/>
                begging for any path<br/>
                that might lead her back<br/>
                to the one who had held her<br/>
                beyond judgement.

              <p>
                Aphrodite saw an opportunity.<br/>
                If she could not prevent<br/>
                their love,<br/>
                she could at least<br/>
                make Psyche's path so vicious,<br/>
                so impossible,<br/>
                that no mortal soul<br/>
                would ever dare rival a goddess again.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                And so the trials began—<br/>
                the sorting of seeds,<br/>
                the gathering of deadly wool,<br/>
                the descent to the realm of the dead.<br/>
                Each task more cruel than the last.<br/>
                Each task designed to break her.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Yet behind every cruelty,<br/>
                another force moved quietly:<br/>
                Ants who understood seeds.<br/>
                Reeds who knew when to whisper warnings.<br/>
                An eagle who could fly where she could not.<br/>
                A tower who chose to speak directions<br/>
                to the Underworld.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Some say it was luck.<br/>
                Some say it was secret gods.<br/>
                Some say it was Zeus.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                But others,<br/>
                those who see the world<br/>
                in its deeper pattern,<br/>
                know this:<br/>
                Love was helping Soul<br/>
                even when they were apart.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                Eros, even in exile,<br/>
                was still the current<br/>
                shaping outcomes—<br/>
                through allies,<br/>
                through omens,<br/>
                through the invisible weave<br/>
                of compassion and chance.

              <p>
                His arrows were no longer<br/>
                just weapons.<br/>
                They had become<br/>
                bridges.
